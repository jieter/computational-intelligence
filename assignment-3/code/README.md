## Python optimisation
```python
try:
	import psyco
	psyco.full()
except:
	pass
```

## improvement ideas
 - convert to graph
 - Descrease probability of going backwards except when at a dead end
 - When coming to an already visited location, remove part of the trail and make that part less likely to be visited by that ant in that iteration.
